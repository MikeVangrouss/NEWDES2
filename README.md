15552-bit keys.
 
Based on NEWDES by Robert Scott

Uses MD2II hash function to create the 15552-bit keys.
 
Code free for all, even for commercial software

Compile with gcc: gcc newdes2.c -o newdes2

NEWDES2 was released in 2006 and is based on NEWDES, the subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function, representing 15552 bits. Thus attacks against NEWDES do not work with NEWDES2.
